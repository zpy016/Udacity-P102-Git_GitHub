When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work on multiple comuputers or I work with someone else or I want a secure cope online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Beacuse it give me more control on what I really want to commit to online version of my repository. If it turns out that the local repository is in a worse condition than the online version, I have the option of pulling the online one to cover the local one.
