暂存区与工作目录和版本库有何不同？你认为它具有什么价值？

Working Directory
Working Area, using “git add” to add files to staging area

Staging area
It is a place to store files for making a commit so that they become a new commit in a repository.

Repository
It contains all the versions of all file that is in the repository.

Staging area is used to prepare files to be committed. After files are commited, they will become a new commit in repository.


“git diff” will compare working directory and staging area
“git diff —-staged” will compare staging area and the most recent commit in the repository
“git diff commit_#1 commit_#2” will compare two commits in the repository

“git reset —-hard” will left all modifications in the working directory and staging area. !!!Be careful, in repository you can always go to a previous version/commit without loosing anything in the current one. But reverse the working directory or the staging area will never be able to redo.

如何使用暂存区确保为每项逻辑更改进行一次提交？

I will “git add” any logical change to staging area and use “git commit” to commit to the depository.
